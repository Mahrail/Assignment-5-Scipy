# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Purpose
This project analyzes Fisher's Iris dataset to understand the physical characteristics of three different species of irises.

## Class Design and Implementation
This project utilizes Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. The main components include loading data, calculating statistics, and assessing species similarity.

### Attributes
- `iris_data`: DataFrame containing the iris dataset.
- `correlation_matrix`: Matrix showing correlation between different measurements.
- `species_means`: Mean values for each species for analysis.

### Methods
- `mean()`: Calculates average measurements for each species.
- `median()`: Calculates median measurements for each species.
- `std()`: Calculates standard deviation for each measurement.

## Limitations
The analysis is limited to the Iris dataset, which may not capture all variations in iris species. Correlation does not imply causation.
